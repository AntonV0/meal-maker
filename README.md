# Meal Maker
## Project #30 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
The aim of this project is to create a function that allows a restaurant to set a meal and its price each morning for Today's Special. I was introduced to JavaScript objects, as well as getter and setter methods.
## What I Learned
  - Objects and their properties with underscores
  - Setter methods that check the values being assigned (using if statements and the typeof operator)
  - Getter methods to return property values in a readable form (using if statements and this._property)
